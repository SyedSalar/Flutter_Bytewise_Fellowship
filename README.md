# Week 2 Tasks

In this week I learnt many things. They are divided into three topics which are described below:
## State Management
## Providers
## Rest Apis

## State Management
There are many ways we can manage the state of our Front End in flutter. First of all I understood what is state in depth? Difference between stateful and stateless widgets. How set state works? How other state management packages are better in managing the state than set state?

## Providers
While working on Providers I worked upon three examples from the provided youtube playlist by our instructor and I understood the concept of Providers. They help in not building the whole tree but only the thing which we want with the help of Consumer.

## Rest Apis
In this I learnt What is Rest Apis, How they work? What is JSON Format. I learnt about the tool Postman and worked upon the Package HTTP in flutter by using GET and POST apis.
