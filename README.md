# Week 2 Tasks

In this week I learnt many things. They are divided into three topics which are described below:
## State Management
## Providers
## Rest Apis

## State Management
There are many ways we can manage the state of our Front End in flutter. First of all I understood what is state in depth? Difference between stateful and stateless widgets. How set state works? How other state management packages are better in managing the state than set state?

## Providers
While working on Providers I worked upon three examples from the provided youtube playlist by our instructor and I understood the concept of Providers. They help in not building the whole tree but only the thing which we want with the help of Consumer.

## Rest Apis
In this I learnt What is Rest Apis, How they work? What is JSON Format. I learnt about the tool Postman and worked upon the Package HTTP in flutter by using GET and POST apis. 


# Week 3 Tasks
Week 3 was all about Firebase and Packages. So I developed a functioning app. I have used firebase firestore and storage in multiple apps. But I will present my Pest Controlling App. 
I developed an application from scratch using Flutter Dart and integrated it with Firebase Firestore. The application had features like OTP login and notifier, which enabled users to login securely and receive notifications from the app. I used Flutter Dart programming language to develop the application and integrated Firebase's authentication and cloud database services. This gave me hands-on experience with application development and integration with a cloud database.
